# Windows Management Framework 4.0
For installing/fixing Microsoft Exchange 2013 on pre Windows Server 2012 machines.

This is placed here in under the terms of fair use:
 - These binary files were licenced and freely available on the Microsoft website under the same copyright as currently displayed during installation.
 - These binary files are currently freely available on the WayBackMachine archive.
 - These files are required for using other Microsoft products.
 - These files are not modified, and full attribution is given to Microsoft.
 - If and when these files are available again on the Microsoft website, I fully accept that this repo can be removed.

I see no reason why these files should be hosted on WayBackMachine and use their bandwidth when Microsoft have deliberately removed them from their own website, admitted it's a problem and still not fixed anything 3 years later.
